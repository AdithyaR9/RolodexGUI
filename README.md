Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function.

This is a Rolodex application that runs with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

*I created it to solve a problem that no longer exists, my dad said his rolodex in the 1990s was too cluttered :). - I didn't even know they existed till I saw them in a movie and asked him about them

- JK I created it because I thought it could be cool, and to get better and more efficient at creating applications with a GUI element.
